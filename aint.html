			<h1>Segment Trees</h1>
			<p>In computer science, a segment tree, also known as a statistic tree, is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. A similar data structure is the interval tree.</p>
			<h2>Structure description</h2>
			<p>Let S be a set of intervals, or segments. Let p1, p2, ..., pm be the list of distinct interval endpoints, sorted from left to right. Consider the partitioning of the real line induced by those points. The regions of this partitioning are called elementary intervals. Thus, the elementary intervals are, from left to right: (-&infin;, p<sub>1</sub>), [p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>1</sub>], (p<sub>1</sub>, <sub>2</sub>), [p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>], ... ,(p<sub>m-1</sub>, p<sub>m</sub>), [p<sub>m</sub>, p<sub>m</sub>], (p<sub>m</sub>, +&infin;)</p>
			<p>That is, the list of elementary intervals consists of open intervals between two consecutive endpoints p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>i+1</sub>, alternated with closed intervals consisting of a single endpoint. Single points are treated themselves as intervals because the answer to a query is not necessarily the same at the interior of an elementary interval and its endpoints.</p>
			<p>Given a set I of intervals, or segments, a segment tree T for I is structured as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>T is a binary tree.</li>
				<li>Its leaves correspond to the elementary intervals induced by the endpoints in I, in an ordered way: the leftmost leaf corresponds to the leftmost interval, and so on. The elementary interval corresponding to a leaf v is denoted Int(v).</li>
				<li>The internal nodes of T correspond to intervals that are the union of elementary intervals: the interval Int(N) corresponding to node N is the union of the intervals corresponding to the leaves of the tree rooted at N. That implies that Int(N) is the union of the intervals of its two children.</li>
				<li>Each node or leaf v in T stores the interval Int(v) and a set of intervals, in some data structure. This canonical subset of node v contains the intervals [x, x′] from I such that [x, x′] contains Int(v) and does not contain Int(parent(v)). That is, each node in T stores the segments that span through its interval, but do not span through the interval of its parent.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Construction</h2>
			<p>A segment tree from the set of segments I, can be built as follows. First, the endpoints of the intervals in I are sorted. The elementary intervals are obtained from that. Then, a balanced binary tree is built on the elementary intervals, and for each node v it is determined the interval Int(v) it represents. It remains to compute the canonical subsets for the nodes. </p>
			<h2>Query</h2>
			<p>A query for a segment tree, receives a point qx(should be one of the leaves of tree), and retrieves a list of all the segments stored which contain the point qx.</p>
			<p>Formally stated; given a node (subtree) v and a query point qx, the query can be done using the following algorithm:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If v is not a leaf:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If qx is in Int(left child of v) then perform a query in the left child of v</li>
					<li>If qx is in Int(right child of v) then perform a query in the right child of v</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>In a segment tree that contains n intervals, those containing a given query point can be reported in O(log n + k) time, where k is the number of reported intervals.</p>
