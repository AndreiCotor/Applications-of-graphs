            <h1>Travelling salesman problem</h1>
            <p>The travelling salesman problem (also called the traveling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.</p>
            <h2>Graph Model</h2>
            <p>TSP can be modelled as an undirected weighted graph, such that cities are the graph's vertices, paths are the graph's edges, and a path's distance is the edge's weight. It is a minimization problem starting and finishing at a specified vertex after having visited each other vertex exactly once. Often, the model is a complete graph (i.e., each pair of vertices is connected by an edge). If no path exists between two cities, adding a sufficiently long edge will complete the graph without affecting the optimal tour.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The most direct solution would be to try all permutations (ordered combinations) and see which one is cheapest (using brute-force search). The running time for this approach lies within a polynomial factor of O(n!), the factorial of the number of cities, so this solution becomes impractical even for only 20 cities.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest applications of dynamic programming is the Heldâ€“Karp algorithm that solves the problem in time O(n<sup>2</sup>*2<sup>n</sup>). This bound has also been reached by Exclusion-Inclusion in an attempt preceding the dynamic programming approach.</p>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources will want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources; in such problems, the TSP can be imbedded inside an optimal control problem. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.</p>
