            <h1>Shortest path</h1>
            <p>In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

                The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs, where the vertices correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.</p>

            <h2>Algorithms</h2>
            <p>The most important algorithms for solving this problem are:
            <ul>
                <li>Floyd–Warshall algorithm solves all pairs shortest paths.</li>
                <li>Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem with non-negative edge weight.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Floyd–Warshall</h2>

            <p>The Floyd–Warshall algorithm compares all possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices. It is able to do this with O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) comparisons in a graph, even though there may be up to O(|V|<sup>2</sup>) edges in the graph, and every combination of edges is tested. It does so by incrementally improving an estimate on the shortest path between two vertices, until the estimate is optimal.</p>

                <p>Consider a graph G with vertices V numbered 1 through N. Further consider a function shortestPath(i,j,k) that returns the shortest possible path from i to j using vertices only from the set {1,2,...,k} as intermediate points along the way. Now, given this function, our goal is to find the shortest path from each i to each j using any vertex in {1,2,...,N}.</p>
                
                <p>For each of these pairs of vertices, the shortestPath(i,j,k) could be either:
                <ol>
                <li> a path that does not go through k (only uses vertices in the set {1,2,...,k-1})</li>
                <li>a path that does go through k (from i to k and then from k to j, both only using intermediate vertices in {1,2,...,k}</li> 
                </ol></p>
                <p>We know that the best path from i to j that only uses vertices 1 through k-1 is defined by shortestPath(i,j,k-1), and it is clear that if there was a better path from i to k to j, then the length of this path would be the concatenation of the shortest path from i to k (only using intermediate vertices in {1,2,...,k-1} and the shortest path from k to j (only using intermediate vertices in {1,2,...,k-1}).</p>
                
                <p>If w(i,j) is the weight of the edge between vertices i and j, we can define shortestPath(i,j,k) in terms of the following recursive formula: the base case is</p>
                
                <p><i><b>shortestPath(i,j,0)=w(i,j)</b></i></p>
                <p>and the recursive case is</p>
                
                <p><i><b>shortestPath(i,j,k)=min(shortestPath(i,j,k-1),shortestPath(i,k,k-1)+shortestPath(k,j,k-1)).</b></i></p>
                <p>This formula is the heart of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. The algorithm works by first computing shortestPath(i,j,k) for all (i,j) pairs for k=1, then k=2, and so on. This process continues until k=N, and we have found the shortest path for all (i,j) pairs using any intermediate vertices.</p>

            <h2>Dijkstra</h2>
            <p>Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.</p>
            <ol><li>Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.</li>
                <li>Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the initial node as current.
                <li>For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a  distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.</li>
                <li>When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.</li>
                <li>If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.</li></ol>
            <p>When planning a route, it is actually not necessary to wait until the destination node is "visited" as above: the algorithm can stop once the destination node has the smallest tentative distance among all "unvisited" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next "current").</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Suppose you would like to find the shortest path between two intersections on a city map: a starting point and a destination. Dijkstra's algorithm initially marks the distance (from the starting point) to every other intersection on the map with infinity. This is done not to imply that there is an infinite distance, but to note that those intersections have not been visited yet. Some variants of this method leave the intersections' distances unlabeled. Now select the current intersection at each iteration.  For the first iteration, the current intersection will be the starting point, and the distance to it (the intersection's label) will be <i>zero</i>. For subsequent iterations (after the first), the current intersection will be a closest unvisited intersection to the starting point (this will be easy to find).
            </p>
            <p>From the current intersection, update the distance to every unvisited intersection that is directly connected to it. This is done by determining the sum of the distance between an unvisited intersection and the value of the current intersection and then relabeling the unvisited intersection with this value (the sum) if it is less than the unvisited intersection's current value. In effect, the intersection is relabeled if the path to it through the current intersection is shorter than the previously known paths.  To facilitate shortest path identification, in pencil, mark the road with an arrow pointing to the relabeled intersection if you label/relabel it, and erase all others pointing to it.  After you have updated the distances to each neighboring intersection, mark the current intersection as visited and select an unvisited intersection with minimal distance (from the starting point) – or the lowest label—as the current intersection. Intersections marked as visited are labeled with the shortest path from the starting point to it and will not be revisited or returned to.
            </p>
            <p>Continue this process of updating the neighboring intersections with the shortest distances, marking the current intersection as visited, and moving onto a closest unvisited intersection until you have marked the destination as visited. Once you have marked the destination as visited (as is the case with any visited intersection), you have determined the shortest path to it from the starting point and can trace your way back following the arrows in reverse. In the algorithm's implementations, this is usually done (after the algorithm has reached the destination node) by following the nodes' parents from the destination node up to the starting node; that's why we also keep track of each node's parent.
            </p>
            <p>This algorithm makes no attempt of direct "exploration" towards the destination as one might expect. Rather, the sole consideration in determining the next "current" intersection is its distance from the starting point. This algorithm therefore expands outward from the starting point, interactively considering every node that is closer in terms of shortest path distance until it reaches the destination. When understood in this way, it is clear how the algorithm necessarily finds the shortest path. However, it may also reveal one of the algorithm's weaknesses: its relative slowness in some topologies.
            </p>
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>A road network can be considered as a graph with positive weights. The nodes represent road junctions and each edge of the graph is associated with a road segment between two junctions. The weight of an edge may correspond to the length of the associated road segment, the time needed to traverse the segment, or the cost of traversing the segment. Using directed edges it is also possible to model one-way streets. Such graphs are special in the sense that some edges are more important than others for long-distance travel (e.g. highways). This property has been formalized using the notion of highway dimension. There are a great number of algorithms that exploit this property and are therefore able to compute the shortest path a lot quicker than would be possible on general graphs.</p>
